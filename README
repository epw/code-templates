This is a simple example of how Python can be used to generate new
files from "code templates."

The file configuration.py contains basic options. They should be
changed as they refer to specific directories for my machine, as
demonstrations.

The example template simple-java can be used in the following manner
with no customization at all:

     $ python template.py code-templates/simple-java Eric

Which will create Eric.java in the directory it is executed from.

template.py can be executed directly, and can also be renamed, such as
just to "template", without issue. If it is moved to a different
directory, such as a bin/, be sure to copy configuration.py there as
well.
